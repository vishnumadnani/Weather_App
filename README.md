#Weather App

The Weather App is a user-friendly tool designed to fetch and display the current weather information for any city or state. This app leverages several web technologies to deliver a seamless and interactive experience:

HTML5: Provides the structure and layout of the app, defining elements like the input field, button, and result display area.
CSS3: Enhances the visual appeal of the app with modern styling, including the use of custom fonts, gradients, and responsive design elements to ensure a great user experience across different devices.
JavaScript: Implements the core functionality of the app, including handling user input, making HTTP requests to fetch weather data, and dynamically updating the user interface with the fetched data.
OpenWeatherMap API: A third-party service that supplies real-time weather data based on the city or state name entered by the user. The API provides details such as temperature, weather conditions, and more, which are then displayed in the app.
Key Features
Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches and displays the current weather, including temperature, weather conditions, and descriptions.
Dynamic User Interface: Updates the weather information dynamically based on user input.
Responsive Design: Ensures the app looks and functions well on different screen sizes and devices.
